## Steps

2. **Think of a dope solution!** ðŸ¤”
3. Sketch out how the solution will work.
4. Determine the data models that constitute the solution you're building?
5. Change the name of application in `package.json`
6. Run `npm install`
7. Change the name of database in `docker-compose.yml`
8. Create queries which will provide the API-side solution.
9. Create mutations to which will trigger the API to perform the operations which will provide the solution (such as create, read, update, and delete operations on the data).
10. Add the API schema to `src/schema.ts`
11. Write tests, you sick bastard!
12. PROFITS!!
