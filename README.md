## Steps

Think of a great idea...

What is going to do?

How is it going to do it?

Model data that application will need to handle

Change the name of the database in `docker-compose.yml`

Create models

Create mutations to create, read, update, and delete data

Add your API schema to `src/schema.ts`

Write tests, you sick bastard!

PROFITS!!
